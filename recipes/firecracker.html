    <h1>FireCracker Chicken</h1>
    <img src="/img/firecracker-chicken.webp" alt="" style="height:400px ;width: 500px;">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Firecracker chicken is very similar to sweet and sour chicken, only much spicier (hence the name). Browning the chicken keeps it moist and tender and if you serve it over rice, the heat is mellowed out.</p>

    <h3>Incredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Crystal®)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place a rack in the center of the oven.</li>
        <li>Combine cornstarch, ginger, pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt in a large resealable bag or large bowl. Place beaten eggs in a large shallow bowl or dish. Add chicken to bag and shake to coat.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high until shimmering.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Repeat with remaining chicken, adding 1 tablespoon of oil to the skillet per new batch (3 batches total).</li>
        <li>Stir together honey, hot sauce, vinegar, crushed red pepper, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Pour over chicken in the baking dish and stir to coat.</li>
    </ol>
